Module Details

Subject: Business  Management
IntroductionWelcome to your dissertation - the capstone project of the Masters programme. It allows you to explore your focus and interests in an independent manner.  It provides the opportunity for you to apply, integrate, and deepen the knowledge, insights, and skills that you have learned during your programme of study.  You can explore in this project a real-world issue or a research topic, which you execute in a manner consistent with the core philosophy and values of Lincoln International Business School (LIBS).In keeping with the spirit of LIBS Masters programmes, this module seeks to enable and facilitate independence, innovation and creativity in terms of project foci, form and output. This module also differs in how you engage with it. With the aim of creating independent and critical learners, you are required to not only undertake an in-depth study of a topic related to the title of your named degree but also to take responsibility for your own learning and negotiate the form. and output of the final work. So, this work is led by you.You should enjoy the experience because this really is a module you can own and direct.You will decide on a proposal approach to your research, so as to provide a clear path to follow, goals to achieve and generate a final dissertation thesis / output. Although the foci and form. of the dissertation are to be negotiated, you might produce one of the following:· Independent research project· Design of a new enterprise· Guided individual research project (determined and initially scoped by an academic tutor)· Work-based project· Client based project· Other negotiated project (consultancy, event/exhibition design, multi-media project, etc.).
The exact format will vary and can be agreed with your seminar facilitators. As with the delivery last year, we will continue to use and develop the following resources:· The use and integration of the University’s online ethical application and approval process (LEAS)· The use of a structured guidance to support your research dissertation.
Please note that this module is an independent learning project so which ever form. of dissertation you chose, every one will get the same support through lectures, seminars and drop ins.
These are reviewed in turn shortly in this book and availab代 写BUS9036M Dissertation 2023-2024
